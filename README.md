Welcome to **Data Structures and Algorithms with Java - Visualized!** This repository is dedicated to providing clear and intuitive visualizations of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. Understanding how these concepts work under the hood is crucial for any aspiring software engineer, and what better way to learn than through engaging animations?

## ‚ú® What Makes This Repository Special?

* **Interactive Visualizations:** Witness data structures in action! Our animations bring abstract concepts to life, making it easier to grasp the mechanics of insertion, deletion, searching, sorting, and more.
* **Clear Java Implementations:** Each visualization is backed by well-commented and easy-to-understand Java code. You can see the algorithm in action and then dive into the corresponding implementation.
* **Focus on Fundamentals:** We cover the essential building blocks of computer science, providing a solid foundation for tackling more complex problems.
* **Learning by Doing (and Seeing!):** This repository encourages a deeper understanding by connecting the visual representation directly to the code.

## üöÄ Explore the Visualizations

Here's a sneak peek at some of the data structures and algorithms you'll find visualized:

### Data Structures

* **Arrays:** Basic operations, dynamic arrays.
* **Linked Lists:** Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with insertion, deletion, and traversal animations.
* **Stacks:** Push and pop operations visualized.
* **Queues:** Enqueue and dequeue operations illustrated.
* **Trees:**
    * **Binary Trees:** Insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order) animations.
    * **Binary Search Trees (BST):** Insertion, deletion, and search operations visualized.
* **Heaps:** Binary heaps with insertion and extraction animations.
* **Hash Tables:** Insertion, deletion, and collision handling (e.g., separate chaining, open addressing) visualized.
* **Graphs:** Different graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and basic traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS) animated.

### Algorithms

* **Sorting Algorithms:**
    * **Bubble Sort:** See how elements "bubble up" to their correct positions.
    * **Insertion Sort:** Watch elements being inserted into their sorted place.
    * **Selection Sort:** Observe the smallest (or largest) element being selected and placed.
    * **Merge Sort:** Understand the divide-and-conquer approach with clear merging steps.
    * **Quick Sort:** Witness the partitioning and recursive sorting process.
* **Searching Algorithms:**
    * **Linear Search:** See how each element is checked sequentially.
    * **Binary Search:** Observe the efficient searching in a sorted array.
* **Graph Algorithms:**
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Visualize level-by-level traversal.
    * **Depth-First Search (DFS):** See how the algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch.

**(Note: This is a sample list. The actual repository content might have more or fewer visualizations. Update this list based on the actual contents of the repository.)**

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ishii-ag/dsa-with-java.git](https://github.com/ishii-ag/dsa-with-java.git)
    cd dsa-with-java
    ```

2.  **Explore the Code:** Navigate through the directories to find the Java implementations and any associated visualization code (e.g., using a graphics library or a web-based approach).

3.  **Run the Visualizations:** Follow the instructions within each specific directory (if provided) to run the visualizations. This might involve:
    * Running a Java application with a graphical user interface.
    * Opening an HTML file in your web browser if the visualizations are web-based.

4.  **Study the Code and the Animation:** Observe how the animation reflects the steps in the Java code. This connection is key to understanding the underlying logic.
